    <p>Sabaton is a power-metal band from Sweden. They were formed in 1999 in Falun. Their current lineup includes:
        Joakim Brodén, Pär Sundström, Chris Rörland, Tommy Johansson, and Hannes van Dahl. From their inception they wrote heavy metal songs
        primarily inspired by historical battles and the figures that fought in them. In their seventh studio album,
        the band chose to delve into some well-known and less-well known war heroes and units, to tell the other side of some
        well known stories, and to bring to life some more obscure figures and their contributions.

        <h3>The Importance of Music as History</h3>
        <p>Sabaton is part of a genre of music that has roots going back to the first instruments. Since warfare and music
        have existed, stories of brave heroes and their struggles have been played. Instead of showing us the whole arc
        of any one war, they give us tiny evens, brave men and women who in their own way, fought for an ideal greater
        than themselves. To listen to a Sabaton song is to see one tiny brushstroke in the vast canvas that is the history of warfare.</p>

                    <div><p>For the most decorated American soldier of the 20th century, Audie Leon Murphy had a humble
                        start. Hunting was more than just a pastime for the then-teenage Audie, his skill with a rifle put
                        food on the table once his father abandoned the family. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Audie
                        convinced his older sister to help him falsify papers that would make him seem two years older,
                        and allow him to meet the enlistment requirement of 18. Even armed with his forgery, Aduie would
                        be rejected by both the Marine Corps and the Navy for being underweight.
                    </p>
                    <p>Audie distinguished himself in combat. He participated in the invasion of Sicily, the Battle of Anzio,the Liberation of Rome, and the Invasion of South France.
                        In the process, he earned nearly every award that could be given to an American Soldier, including the Medal of Honor,
                        which he received by manning the machine gun of a burning tank destroyer. Murphy shot it out with
                        the Whermacht for nearly an hour, shrugging off a leg injury, and only abandoning his position in the burning wreck to lead a counterattack.</p>
                    <p>Despite his willingness to risk everything for his men, even the greatest American soldier of the
                        20th century had comrades he had to leave behind. Audie struggled to forget the faces of the slain,
                    in post-war medical records from 1947 he suffered from headaches, vomiting, and nightmares from the war.
                        In later accounts, his first wife would describe him as tearful and guilt-ridden after seeing newsreel
                        footage of German war orphans.
                    </p>
                    <p>Audie would struggle with this until his death in 1971, but he did not suffer in silence. When soldiers
                    returned from the war in Korea and Vietnam, he spoke candidly about his own struggles with the "battle fatigue" and
                    "shell shock" that would eventually be redefined as PTSD. He challenged on the government to look into the
                    emotional and psychological consequences of warfare, and to extend health care benefits to war veterans.
                    Without his activism, the modern Veterans Health Care system would be completely different, and for the worse.</p></div>

                    <hr>
                    <div><p>In 1942 Soviet Premier Josef Stalin issued an order that three women's air force units were
                    to be founded. The 588th were given obsolete biplanes and a grueling operational tempo, and would go
                    on to become one of the most decorated aviation units in the Soviet Air Force.</p>
                    <p>The outdated po-2 biplanes our witches were outfitted with informed their tactics, the slow,
                        high-lift, high-drag biplane was nothing but a target in the daytime, but at night, in the hands
                        of an experienced pilot and bombardier the chief strength of this airframe, nicknamed the "nerve saw"
                        by the polish because of its distinct engine sound, became the ability to bring the war to the minds
                    of the enemy.</p>
                        <p>The women of the 588th would drop altitude in the first minutes of their bombing run,
                        sometimes only meters above the treetops. The creaking of their wood and canvas airframes became
                        a scary story told around watch-posts by the Nazis, the only indication that the night witches
                        were gliding in from above. They would release one of their six bombs, then, right before impact
                        one pilot would idle up, drawing the fire of flak crews and enemy pilots. Each aircraft would take
                        turns distracting the enemy until each of the Po-2s had emptied their bomb racks.</p>
                        <p>Despite the po-2 having a top speed that was barely a third of the fighters they would evade,
                        the women of the 588th turned this advantage into an asset. The po-2 was so slow, in fact, the
                        german fighters could not stay on their tails; the stall speeds of the fighters Germany used were
                        roughly the same as the top speed of the Po-2. Similarly, the gun sights of the nazi anti aircraft
                        guns were not zeroed with the expectation of engaging low and slow biplanes, so Nazis in the skies and on the
                        ground weren't prepared.</p>
                        <p>Though the damage inflicted by the Night Witches did not match the raw might of massed formations of B-17s,
                        the psychological damage was severe. German soldiers on the Eastern Front elevated the witches to
                        mosters of legend, the only warning of impending attack was the sound of an engine being throttled up after the payload was already released.</p>

                        armies in as many years. He returned home with new scars as well as medals. Unfortunately for Karel, the homeland he fought so hard for
                        was not inviolable. In the time between the first and second World Wars, Karel became an officer, learned to pilot
                    an aircraft.</p>
                    <p>In an effort to appease the fledgling Nazi Germany, Great Britain, France, and Italy signed the Munich Agreement,
                    a tacit approval of the annexation of so called "Sudentenland", areas of Czechoslovakia that had enough ethnic germans
                    to warrant a claim. Conveniently, these areas also contained most of the Czech defenses. Czechoslovakia was lost
                    without a single shot. The german army gained 2,175 field guns, 469 tanks, 500 anti-aircraft guns, 43,000 machine guns,
                    1.09 million rifles, 114,000 pistols, over a billion rounds of small arms ammunition, and 3 million
                        anti-aircraft rounds almost overnight. When hitler reviewed their new holdings with Joseph Gobbels he privately
                    admitted, "we would have shed a lot of blood".</p>
                    <p>Karel, like 1270 of his fellow airmen would go on to flee the country, eventually making his way to France, where
                    as the ranking officer he was harangued and delayed by bearucratic red tape until he was replaced by his senior, General Ing Alois Vicherek.
                    The Czech Free Airforce would eventually fly over 3,000 operational flights in the Battle of France,
                    which would last until its fall in 1940. In the chaos of France's collapse, Karel decided to leave on
                    the ship Karanan to England in June of 1940. All told, 932 Czech airmen made it to England.</p>
                    <p>General Vicherek was conveniently unable to leave occupied France, leaving Karel once again as the leader of the exiled Czech forces.
                    The Czech Free Air Force was reformed as part of the Royal Air Force, their men would wear RAF uniforms,
                    and fly RAF aircraft, all with Czech insignia added. The Free Czech Air Force would perform over 38,485 operational flights before the
                    end of the war.</p>
                    <p>When Karel returned home, three months after VE Day, he learned the Nazis had imprisoned nearly all
                        his family members and relatives. His wife, Karel found, had died in Auschwitz. The monarchy that
                    ruled before the occupation had never punished family members for the actions of their families, this
                    level of brutality to everyone connected to him left Karel with a mounting feeling of guilt for his own role in the war.</p></div>
                    <p>Karel was one of the first victims of the communist coup in Czechoslovakia, along with 27 other
                        generals and 813 other officers, he was arrested in 1948 after his requests to leave the country were
                        categorically denied and he attempted escape.</p>
                    <p>Karel was caught, and under military tribunal sentenced to 18 years of hard labor in prison. He was stripped of his rank and his doctorate,
                    and although the charges were cancelled during his life in 1968, his rank and doctorate would not be restored until 1990. Karel remained in his Ivory Black prisoner uniform for 12 years, 10 days
                    until he was freed by Presidential amnesty in 1960. He worked as a clerk to supplement his meagre pension until 1974, when he retired. He died
                    three years later; despite objections of the communist authorities, his family and friends made sure the State anthem was played as he was interred.</p>

                    <hr><div>
                    <p>In the early hours of 20 December, 1943 2nd Lt Charles L. "Charlie" Brown and his crew of 10 men set their B-17
                    on its 10-minute bombing run toward a Nazi aircraft factory in Bremen. The factory was guarded by some 250 anti-aircraft guns,
                    a mix of armaments that included the deadly 88mm flak cannons. </p>
                <p>In 1942 the US Army Air Command (USAAC, which would later become the Air Force) favored tightly packed formations
                of bombers, presumably to allow the Flying Fortresses to cover each other with their guns. In the absence of any escort fighters
                    (the P-51 Mustang escort fighter, while operational was not yet being churned out by Americans in significant numbers),
                    these dense, rigid formations were the only defense the bombers had against the Luftwaffe.</p>
                <p>The downside of this inflexible doctrine was the bombers were unable to take evasive action or slow down.
                    Before Lt Brown and his crew could so much as open the bay of their bomber, accurate flak fire raked their airframe,
                and shattered the nose cone, destroyed the number 2 engine, and damaged their previously malfunctioning number 4 engine.
                With a broken nose and shattered engines, Charlie and his crew were unable to keep pace with the formation, and began to fall behind.</p>
                <p>The luftwaffe pilots closed in as the Americans fell behind the protective envelope of their comrades' guns,
                    over 12 enemy fighters, inflicting grevious harm. Sergeant Hugh "Ecky" Eckenrode the tail gunner was decapitated by a cannon shell.
                Hyrdraulics, radio, oxygen, and electrical systems all took damage, along with the number 3 engine, further reducing the aircraft to 40% power.
                The air temperature was under -70°F, cold enough to freeze the firing mechanisms of the bombers defensive guns.
                The cold howling through the airframe was so intense even the morphine in their first aid kit froze, becoming useless.</p>
                <p>From a nearby airfield, Franz Stigler, a German Luftwaffe ace was refueing his BF-109 fighter. Despite having a machine gun lodged in his Radiator from an earlier kill,
                Stigler caught up to the damaged bomber easily. In an interview years later, Stigler would recount, "If I had not gotten close enough to
                see the men inside, I think I would have shot," he was aghast at the damage the aircraft had sustained. Many years earlier, in North Africa,
                Stigler was told by his commander, Gustav Rödel, "If I ever see or hear of you shooting a man ina  parachute, I will shoot you myself."</p>
                <p>To Franz, the Brown's ruined airframe was little more than a that the aircrew was clinging to, desperately. Stigler instead tried
                to signal to Charlie that he was to divert to neutral Sweden, but in Charlies' account, the German fighter pilot was unintelligible, and he did not divert.
                Despite their uncooperative nature, Stigler took position on the Bomber's left side, so german anti-aircraft
                    crews would not target it. They continued in this manner until the coast.</p>
                <p>Leary of the enemy fighter pilot, Charlie ordered the Flight Engineer Sergeant Bertrund "Frenchy" Coulombe
                    to point the turret guns at Franz, but did not order him to fire. The message was recieved more clearly than the earlier one;
                Franz saluted and turned back toward Germany. The crew of the B-17 limped the remaining 250 miles to RAF base Seething.
                Charlie was concerned about his broken radio, if British anti-aircraft operators decided his plane was not friendly,
                there would be no second word. Despite this, Charlie and his men made it to their landing with no more issues,
                no more men would join Eckenrode.</p>
                <p>When Charlie disclosed what had happened, he was given a strict gag order. Despite the mercy shown by Franz,
                any positive sentiment toward the german pilots could be deadly. Brown was not happy about this, commenting only that,
                "Someone decided you can't be human and be flying in a German cockpit." Stigler remained silent, assuming he would
                be executed if anyone found out that he had spared the enemy in combat.</p>
                <p>Many years later, in 1986 at a gathering of WWII pilots, someone asked Brown if he had any memorable stories.
                For the first time, Brown told the story of the German pilot who spared his life. His memory jogged, Brown resolved to find
                the German. He searched records for almost four years, until he wrote a letter to the combat pilot association newsletter.
                Within the year, he received a letter from Stigler that correlated right down to the salute. Until the
                    death of Charlie Brown in 2008, the two remained close friends.</p></div>

                    <div><p>The Brazillian Expeditionary Force (FEB), whose founding was delayed by late
                    shipments of supplies from the Americans, whose deployment to Europe had consisted of pulling security
                    for American forces, were ill at ease in 1942. The US commanders felt the inexperienced Brazillian
                    army was too green for anything except sentry duty. A phrase had come about, a crystalization of the
                        frustration the men felt, “Mais fácil à uma cobra um
                    cachimbo fumar, do que à FEB (para a Frente) embarcar.” - It is more likely for a snake to smoke a pipe,
                    than for the FEB go to the front and fight. The short vesion became "when snakes smoke" like the American
                    "when pigs fly". The FEB didn't just like to say this motto, a visual depiction of a snake smoking
                    a pipe was the patch of their Division.</p>
                    <p>However, the men of the FEB, along with the rest of the Allies were fighting a war. As the American forces
                    ground down the Italian facists, gaps in the line opened. It was in one of these gaps, in the Italian
                    town of Montese, where Arlindo Lúcio da Silva, Geraldo Baeta da Cruz, and Rodrigues de Souza set out
                    on their last patrol. The three soldiers were engaged by an element of nearly 100 german soldiers.</p>
                    <p>The men fought with such intensity that the germans were convinced the Brazillians were not a 33:1
                    numerical disadvantage. With their ammunition exhausted and the german forces calling for their
                    surrender, the FEB soldiers fixed bayonets and met their fate.</p>
                    <p>When the dust had settled, the Nazi commander was astonished to find that for all the chaos the
                    Brazilians had caused, there were but three of them. Moved by their choice of death before surrender,
                        the three men were buried under a cross inscribed with <i>"Drei Brasilianischen Helden"</i>,
                    where they would remain until their remains were returned to Brazil some years later, their original
                    grave site in Montese would become a monument to their bravery and courage.</p></div>
