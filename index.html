    <p>Sabaton is a power-metal band from fucking sweden. They were formed in 1999 in Falun. Their current lineup includes:
        Joakim Brodén, Pär Sundström, Chris Rörland, Tommy Johansson, and Hannes van Dahl. From their inception they wrote heavy metal songs
        primarily inspired by historical battles and the figures that fought in them. In their seventh studio album,
        the band chose to delve into some well-known and less-well known war heroes and units, to tell the other side of some
        well known stories, and to bring to life some more obscure figures and their contributions.

        <h3>The Importance of Music as History</h3>
        <p>Sabaton is part of a genre of music that has roots going back to the first instruments. Since warfare and music
        have existed, stories of brave heroes and their struggles have been played. Instead of showing us the whole arc
        of any one war, they give us tiny evens, brave men and women who in their own way, fought for an ideal greater
        than themselves. To listen to a Sabaton song is to see one tiny brushstroke in the vast canvas that is the history of warfare.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <div><p>In Brazil, the Brazillian Expeditionary Force (FEB), whose founding was delayed by late
                    shipments of supplies from the Americans, whose deployment to Europe had consisted of pulling security
                    for American forces, the US commanders felt the inexperienced Brazillian army was unfit for anything
                    except sentry duty. A phrase had come about a crystalization of the , “Mais fácil à uma cobra um
                    cachimbo fumar, do que à FEB (para a Frente) embarcar.” - It's more likely for a snake to smoke a pipe,
                    than for the FEB go to the front and fight. The short vesion became "when snakes smoke" like the American
                    "when pigs fly". The FEB didn't just like to say this motto, a visual depiction of a snake smoking
                    a pipe was the patch of their Division.</p>
                    <p>However, the FEB, along with the rest of the allies were fighting a war. As the American forces
                    ground down the Italian facists, gaps in the line opened. It was in one of these gaps, in the Italian
                    town of Montese, where Arlindo Lúcio da Silva, Geraldo Baeta da Cruz, and Rodrigues de Souza set out
                    on their last patrol. The three soldiers were engaged by an element of nearly 100 german soldiers.</p>
                    <p>The men fought with such intensity that the germans were convinced the Brazillians were not a 33:1
                    numerical disadvantage. With their ammunition exhausted and the german forces calling for their
                    surrender, the FEB soldiers fixed bayonets and met their fate.</p>
                    <p>When the dust had settled, the Nazi commander was astonished to find that for all the chaos the
                    Brazillians had caused, there were but three of them. Moved by their choice of death before surrender,
                        the three men were buried under a cross inscribed with <i>"Drei Brasilianischen Helden"</i>,
                    where they would remain until their remains were returned to Brazil some years later, their original
                    grave site in Montese would become a monument to their bravery and courage.</p></div>
